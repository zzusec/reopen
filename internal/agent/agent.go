// Package agent is the contract between the interface and the coding agents
// whose history it manages.
//
// Each agent stores sessions its own way and offers its own operations. What
// varies is expressed as capability — an agent that cannot archive simply does
// not implement [Archiver], and the keys for it are never shown — rather than
// as flags the interface has to remember to consult.
